In the gym, the coach says if you are not in pain, this means that you will not develop ,because the pain is a sign that your body is growing and getting stronger.

## Big O

-----

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm , Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario .

- O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time .
- O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
- O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
- O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
