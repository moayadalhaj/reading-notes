# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

-----

## Functional Programming Concepts

### 1. What is functional programming?

- It is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### 2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- The function that contains fixed data inside it, and it will not affect any other global variables as an examble.

- We know the function is pure by :

 1. It will return the same result for same argument every time.
 2. It will not make any observable side effects.

### 3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

- We can test the pure functions easier than impure functions.

### 4. What is immutability?

- It is the fixed data that will not be able to change over the time.

### 5. What is Referential transparency?

- When we have a pure function with immutable data then we will have the referential transparency.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners 6 - `Modules and require()`

### 1. What is a module?

- That is a component or thing(function, variable,..) that you would use it outside his original file.

### 2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

- It will import the exported module into the new file.

### 3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- We have to import it and use it by require method.

### 4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

- Export it firstly from its original file, then import it to the new file by require.

## Things I want to know more about

- Practice with modules and learning more about functional programming.
