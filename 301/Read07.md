# REST

------

## How I explained REST to my brother

### 1. Who is Roy Fielding?

- that person who created the HTTP protocol.

### 2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- Beacuase the protocols that we are using now have two parts, human readable part and machine readable part. and there are a lot of languages that we are using to make machines talking to each other, therefore we use URLs to deal with all machines wuth all different languages.

### 3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- This protocol that allows the computers talking to each other and sending data beatween each other.

### 4. What does a GET do?

- Requesting data or representation from the resource URL for a certain concept.

### 5. What does a POST do?

- Adding data from one machine to another.

### 6. What does PUT do?

- Replacing something from one machine to another.

### 7. What does PATCH do?

- To do a partial update on a certain machine.
