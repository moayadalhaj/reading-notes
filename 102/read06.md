## What is the function and control flow in JavaScript?
-----

### function: is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).


**There are two ways to define a simple function:**

```
  function nameFunction(parameters) {
  return or block of code
  }
```

```
  var nameFunction = function (parameters) {
  return or block of code
  }
```
function shoud has name so it can excuted when invokes it, and inside the parentheses the parmater/s so it can contain one parameter or more separated by comma.
Then the code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly braces.


### Control flow: is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

The code is run line by line from top to bottom.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
